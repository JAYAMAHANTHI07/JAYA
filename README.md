# HEALTH CARE SQL PROJECT

# The SQL script provided creates a robust database schema for a hospital management system. It includes comprehensive tables such as DEPARTMENT, WORKER, DOCTOR, PATIENT, BILL, MEDICATION, and others. The relationships between entities are well-defined using primary and foreign keys. This schema supports key functionalities like tracking departments, staff, doctors, patients, cafeteria services, bills, diagnoses, tests, and prescribed medications.

# Key Observations and Achievements:

# Comprehensive Schema Design:
# All major hospital entities and their relationships are covered.
# Foreign key constraints enforce data integrity between related tables.

# Data Insertion:
# Sample data is inserted for testing queries, covering diverse scenarios such as department workers, patient treatments, and prescribed medications.

# Query Execution:

# Queries demonstrate the schema's ability to handle practical use cases:
# Finding doctors treating specific illnesses.
# Listing patients prescribed certain medications.
# Retrieving patient and diagnosis details.
# Calculating total salaries of workers.
# Analyzing cafeteria staff and food served.
# Analytical Insights:

# Queries provide insights into the hospital's operation, such as:
# Worker distribution across departments.
# Patient diagnoses and treatments.
# Billing and test records for specific patients.
# Total salary expenditure for all workers.

# Data Integrity and Relationships:
# Relationships between doctors, workers, departments, patients, and cafeteria staff are enforced, ensuring consistency.
